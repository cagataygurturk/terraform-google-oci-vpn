# HA VPN between GCP and OCI

This repository contains a drop-in Terraform module that sets up a HA VPN between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## Features:

- On GCP side a HA VPN is set up with two or four tunnels. (See [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-ha-vpn))
- On OCI side two Site-to-Site VPN connections are set up with two connections.
- Both sides are configured to establish BGP sessions between each other, so two platforms automatically learn the routes from each other.
- Proper routes are propagated from the GCP side to enable Private Google Access from OCI.

## Installation 

On OCI side: A compartment, a DRG
On GCP side: A project, a VPC network
